              Passionate full stack developer who thrives on building seamless
              digital experiences from front to back. With a deep understanding
              of responsive design and scalable backend architecture, I create
              web platforms that are both visually striking and technically
              sound.{" "}
              <p>
                My frontend work reflects precision and creativity, while my
                backend logic ensures performance, security, and
                maintainability.
              </p>
              I specialize in crafting recruiter-ready layouts, integrating
              custom SVG graphics, and solving layout bugs with finesse. Every
              project is an opportunity to blend design clarity with engineering
              rigor. Iâ€™m driven by clean code, intuitive user flows, and the
              challenge of turning complex ideas into elegant solutions.
            </p>
            <p>
              
              Whether refining an About Me section or deploying a full stack
              app, I bring focus, resilience, and a commitment to excellence. My
              goal is to deliver work that not only functions flawlessly but
              leaves a lasting impression. Want to tailor this for a specific
              job or add a standout achievement? I can help you sharpen it even
              more.
