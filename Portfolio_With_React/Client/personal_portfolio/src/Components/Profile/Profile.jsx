              Passionate full stack developer who thrives on building seamless
              digital experiences from front to back. With a deep understanding
              of responsive design and scalable backend architecture, I create
              web platforms that are both visually striking and technically
              sound.{" "}
              <p>
                My frontend work reflects precision and creativity, while my
                backend logic ensures performance, security, and
                maintainability.
              </p>
              I specialize in crafting recruiter-ready layouts, integrating
              custom SVG graphics, and solving layout bugs with finesse. Every
              project is an opportunity to blend design clarity with engineering
              rigor. I’m driven by clean code, intuitive user flows, and the
              challenge of turning complex ideas into elegant solutions.
            </p>
            <p>
              
              Whether refining an About Me section or deploying a full stack
              app, I bring focus, resilience, and a commitment to excellence. My
              goal is to deliver work that not only functions flawlessly but
              leaves a lasting impression. Want to tailor this for a specific
              job or add a standout achievement? I can help you sharpen it even
              more.
